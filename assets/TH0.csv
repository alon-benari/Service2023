Consult and Scheduling Process Consultative Store and Forward TeleDermatology uses a two-consult process: 1. PCPs with imagers need to provide the patient?s history so the reader can properly interpret images. Depending on which templates have been adopted by the local program, the PCP is required to provide a minimal history or a complete history. To ensure effective imaging and interpretation, the referring clinician needs to effectively communicate to the imager the areas of concern to photograph. This should include information regarding anatomic locations and the need for dermatoscope images where applicable. Agreement on these processes should be developed and communicated to all involved staff. 2. Once the imager receives the consult request, the patient will either have a walk-in or imaging appointment scheduled for them. The imager will transmit the referring provider?s medical history, TeleDermatology-Telehealth Clinical 11 January 2023 Service Model Manual Revision 5 supplement it if required by conducting a structured interview, take the requested images, and ensure the quality of the images before loading them into VistA Imaging or another approved software program. The imager will then document the visit and close the consult. The imager will submit a consult to the appropriate Dermatology Service TeleReader program. 3. The dermatologist will access the consult via TeleReader and review the images and history provided. This may occur on a different day than the acquisition of the images. The dermatologist then creates a visit for the reading encounter and completes the consult with recommendations of care to the referring provider. The imager and the referring provider are notified of consult completion. The PCP is responsible for initiating treatment and education for the patient. 4. The timeliness of reading the images from the imager to the TeleReader/dermatologist is of utmost importance. The time to read an image/data for Asynchronous/Store and Forward Telehealth is measured by monitoring the number of consults pending and completed at three, seven, and 30 business days from the date of the patient-side imaging encounter entry to the date of the reader side encounter entry. VA requires Asynchronous/Store and Forward Telehealth consults to be completed within seven days. 5. Asynchronous/Store and Forward Telehealth images must be read in 30 business days or less. Telehealth encounters will match up at 30 business days. If images or data are not read or interpreted within 30 business days, they are forever unmatched or forever an orphan.",,Normal- 1-3 business days,,"Furtado, Clinton J.",7/14/2023 18:49,11/3/2023 13:44,"Furtado, Clinton J."

As example, a veteran sent a message on Monday at 1030, but no notification was sent to my email on his behalf. This was a problem (in this case) as the message was related to a missing telehealth link which I could have rectified if I received an alert, but instead the appt was a missed opportunity. I did not know the message existed until I logged into secure message today, several days later, for a separate issue.  This might also account for why I often receive escalated message alerts (i.e., I do not know messages exist until they are escalated).   Second, a veteran indicated that he is receiving error messages when he attempts to send me secure messages about his questions/concerns/clinical care. He is getting an alert that basically prohibits him from contacting the service. He describes this as an issue with several specialty clinics. Do you have suggestions on how I can advise? This is not the only time when my name is not associated with the veteran's drop down menu (in spite of being a provider associated with their care). I can typically fix it by sending the veteran a secure message first (I think).

??Our service received a request to update our ""intrafacility audiology and speech pathology TSA."" (see below)
Sent: Friday, July 21, 2023 11:31 AM
To: GASSUAN, SHANNON (she/her/hers) <SHANNON.GASSUAN@va.gov>
Subject: Intrafacility Audiology and Speech Pathology Telehealth Service Agreement VANCHCSSpeech Pathology Expired: New TSA required.
Importance: High
The Intrafacility Audiology and Speech Pathology Telehealth Service Agreement VANCHCSSpeech Pathology is expiring or has expired.

 You may go to the item and open it to view the attached existing TSA through this link:
https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/NCHCSTelehealthTeam-NCHCSTelehealthTSAandMOULibrary/_layouts/15/listform.aspx?PageType=4&ListId=d2bb452a%2D8398%2D46ce%2D8eba%2Daa9dfb9e06c1&ID=115&ContentTypeID=0x01001EBC3B83308AF44290C52D0BFBE41336007E286E59217D0648A3BDAADF7C682EEF

To help us do this, I have a few questions.

First, the TSA references that it is intrafacility; however it has a PAVA/NCHCS agreement attached. We are unclear what the purpose of this agreement is (lists PAVA as the providing clinic, and NCHCS as the receiving clinic); to our knowledge, Palo Alto is not providing TH services to NCHCS (in speech pathology). ? Do we just delete this?
Second, the executed TSA listed on the sharepoint (that we are being requested to update) does not appear to be the most recently executed TSA. The signatures are from May 2022. The most recent TSA executed for our service is from Dec 2022 (email verifying execution with attached TSA was sent by Matthew David). I can forward the more recent TSA for review.
Third, the points of contact referenced in the TSA are not the same as the points of contact listed on the sharepoint site. Specifically, the provider who does most all of the intrafacility TH is not listed as a provider nor the point of contact per the governing TSA. How do we update this to be congruent with the executed TSA?
Fourth, last year we worked on updating all the providers' certificates to provide TH services. It was our understanding that the names of the providers eligible to provide services would be included as as an addendum to the original TSA (thereby making the renewal of TSAs more efficient). While I see names of telepresenters, I do not see names of providers. Is it no longer necessary to include the names of the providers with the TSA?

Fifth, it was my understanding from discussions last year that our TH TSAs would encompass our entire service (both audiology and speech pathology), with addendums/appendices that were specific to each respective service. Is this still the case? If it is still the case, is this SLP specific TSA renewal required? Would it not fall under our overall service TSA?
Last, because of these incongruities, we would like guidance on how best to rectify the request to update the TSA. Is it sufficient to provide a copy of the Dec 2022 executed TSA for review (see attached, includes audiology and speech pathology, with appendices specific to SLPs)? Does that satisfy the renewal window? since we are unaware of why there is a PAVA/NCHCS interfacility TSA for speech, can we just delete it or let it expire? How do we update the sharepoint entries? Do we delete the entry and start over given the errors on the cover page/entry form (e.g., Points of Contacts are incorrect)? Do we edit the entry to reflect the TSA? How do we do that? The form did not permit editing (for me).

Thanks for clarification on the above. I also reached out by email to both Matthew David (who sent us the most recent executed TSA Dec 2022) and Clinton Furtado (who forwarded the request to update the TSA). We'll wait for guidance before we complete the request. I've also attached copies of the most recently executed TSA and associated appendices for review. Thanks, Sharon

Subject: 60 Day Post Migration to VLAN 1280

Greetings,

Every online video endpoint in MAC area of operations has been migrated to VLAN 1280 L3-USER-Video. The video endpoints (42) listed below have not been migrated due to being offline. Video Endpoints that are needed for VA admin operations or patient care need to be placed online and migrate to VLAN 1280. If not needed, please submit SNOW tickets to have the video endpoints removed from service.

The UCI Video team encourages the sites to place these online and leave them powered on 24/7 to allow for managing and updating.All sites are reminded that per the VA?s Visibility to Everything (V2E) mandate, it is essential that all active VTC endpoints always remain powered on and always connected to the VA Network. This ensures that all endpoints can be properly managed and migrated. If these units are not placed online by23 Sept 2023, they will be decommissioned and removed from TMS/CUCM.

Neurology already has several providers providing telehealth services to Redding and one provides TH to Chico. Dr. Kwee used to cover Chico on the 2nd Thursday of each month but closed that clinic to cover ALS at Mather.

Good afternoon! We are very excited to launch the new national reconciliation process very soon. We ask for your assistance obtaining some information from the sites to ensure we have all the information needed for this process. Since our team will place notes for extensions or alerting providers, we need a clinic to document this. Our encounters will be marked as historical so that no encounters will be generated. We must also ensure a current POC that our team can order retrieval kits under in ROES. Could you have your sites complete Clinic Name (column D) and ROES POC (column E)?

Hi Everyone,
 I noticed the appointment letter for SON THSF DERM PAT incorrectly instructed patients that it was a Telephone appointment instead of a F2F.
A Leaf to correct that has been submitted today. I made sure the patient knows to arrive to the Sonora clinic in person when I scheduled it. 

 I also checked the SON THSF RETINAL PAT and that one looks ok.

I have attached an updated list of locations (including Yountville, Modesto, Stockton).

hi vickilynn, any chance we can get telederm set up at yountville? i suspect that many of the 'derm' patients there could be managed by PC. But without seeing them we cannot know- and since they send consults to VA and they are too far to travel to mather, that means that every little thing gets sent to community care.

thanks,rivkah

Is MHV intended to keep veterans associated with purely diagnostic clinic message groups for life?
Neuro EEG/EMG - SAC


I have seen this a lot, but yesterday received a message from a veteran who I did a single normal diagnostic EEG study on over 5.5 years ago. Luckily he had at least seen a neurologist in the last 3 years so I could sent the message to them without requiring an entire new consult. Vets already routinely have difficulty getting messages to the correct department, adding more impractical options does not seem to be a benefit.I have also had a few vets ask recently if EEG & EMG results are available through MHV, but it is difficult to provide any guidance without any idea what the MHV interface consists of.

","When a Veteran has an appt scheduled into a clinic, the associated SM Triage Group is automatically added to their contact list and remains there unless the clinic is Inactivated.  Sometimes it drops off after a couple of years, but that is hit or miss.  Results are available if they are entered as a CPRS Note or in Imaging.

Currently, the cart is no longer on the network and is not plugged into a power source. We would like to find a location where the cart may be plugged into a power source and ethernet source so we may get the cart back online. Primary Care can then use the cart however they see fit. This is important because we are in the process of replacing the PC on the cart with a new PC that will be imaged to accommodate a new camera that will be installed in February by Global Med. Per our conversation with Christina Butcher RN, we discussed the possibility of putting the cart into a conference room? Please let me know what you all thing. Thank you!

Hello FTCs and Connected Care Chiefs,

At our last FTC meeting, I presented the VISN-wide plan for CRH to assist facilities with capturing CSSRS screenings. As CSSRS compliance is a top priority for all V21 facilities, the CRH worked with the VISN Suicide Prevention Team to develop a first of a kind process for compliance with the screening. The defined process has been presented and approved at the CRH Governance Committee, which has an ELT representative from every facility.

We are at the final stages and need to move quickly as our target start date is 12/18/23. Attached you will find the TSA and individual signature pages for each facility. Please begin the signature routing process as soon as possible. For FTCs, Service Chiefs, or COS who are out, please have their ?acting? sign in their absence.

Return the signature page to Momi (ashlyn.young1@va.gov)by COB 12/8/23.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter?.

Even though Veterans are able to get a message to their PCP regarding lab orders; it would just be more convenient if there were another means of verification.

I have scheduled CVT trainings for this Friday, however I do not yet have access to CPRS, VISTA, nor any of the relevant apps either.
